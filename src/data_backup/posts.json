    "content": "# Wildlife Watching: Atlantic Coast Bird Migration\n\nEvery year, millions of birds follow the Atlantic flyway during their seasonal migrations, creating one of nature's most spectacular shows. The Atlantic coast serves as a crucial corridor for over 500 bird species traveling between their breeding and wintering grounds.\n\n## Understanding the Atlantic Flyway\n\nThe Atlantic flyway extends from the Arctic to South America, following the Atlantic coastline. This route provides essential stopover sites where birds can rest, feed, and prepare for the next leg of their journey.\n\n### Key Migration Periods\n\n#### Spring Migration (March - May)\n- **Peak activity**: Late April to early May\n- **Direction**: Northbound to breeding grounds\n- **Weather patterns**: Following warm fronts\n- **Best viewing**: Early morning hours\n\n#### Fall Migration

beaches\n**Identification**: Curved bill, black belly patch in breeding plumage\n\nThese sandpipers perform synchronized flight displays in large flocks, creating mesmerizing aerial ballets.\n\n### Songbirds\n\n#### Yellow Warbler\n**Migration period**: April-May (spring), August-September (fall)\n**Best viewing locations**: Coastal forests and parks\n**Identification**: Bright yellow with reddish streaks on males\n\nOne of the most numerous warblers, often the first to arrive in spring and among the first to depart in fall.\n\n#### Scarlet Tanager\n**Migration period**: April-May
